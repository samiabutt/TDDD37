1 a) F = {AB -> CD, B -> C}
     AB is primary key. It isn't 2NF since B is a part of a candidate key (AB) and B -> C. It is 1NF since all values are atomic.
  
  b) F = {A -> BCD, C -> D}
  	 A is primary key. It is not 3NF since we have C -> D and C is not in a candidate key, and D is non-prime. It is 2NF since the relational model does not have any set of non-prime attributes that is functionanlly dependent on part of a candidate key.

  c) F = {AB -> CD, C -> B}
     AB is primary key. It is not BCNF since C is not in a candidate key and we have C -> B. It is 3NF as B is prime. 

2.
a) (1)  AB -> C
   (2)  A -> D
   (3)  D -> AE
   (4)  E -> F
   (5)  D -> A (decomposition)
   (6)  D -> E (decomposition)
   (7)  D -> F (transitive)
   (8)  DB -> C (pseudotransitive)
   (9)  DB -> E (augmentation (B with 6) + decomposition)
   (10) DB -> A (augmentation (B with 5) + decomposition)
   (11) DB -> F (augmentation (B with 7) + decomposition)
   (11) DB -> ACEF (additive)

b) We begin with: R={A, B, C, D, E, F} and CK=AB and DB
   Decompose into:
   		R={A, B, C, D} with CK=AB and BD 
   		R2={D, E, F} with CK=D
c) Decompose into:
		R={A, B, C, D} with CK=AB and BD
		R2={D, E} with CK=D
		R3={E, F} with CK=E
d) Decompose into:
  		R={A, B, C} = with CK=AB
  		R2={D, E} with CK=D
		R3={E, F} with CK=E
		R4={A, D} with CK=A and D

3.
a) We assume that it is 1NF (that every attribute is atomic).
   However, it is not 2NF since Author -> AuthorName, Author is a part of a candidate key and AuthorName is non-prime.
b) We begin with: R(Title#, Title, Author#, BookType, Price, AuthorName, Publisher) with CK=Title#,Author#
   Now, we decompose into 2NF:
   		R(Title#, Author#) with CK=Title#,Author#
   		R2(Author#, AuthorName) with CK=Author#
   		R3(Title#, Title, BookType, Price, Publisher) with CK=Title#

   Decompose into 3NF:
   		R(Title#, Author#) with CK=Title#,Author#
   		R2(Author#, AuthorName) with CK=Author#
   		R3(Title#, Title, BookType, Publisher) with CK=Title#
   		R4(BookType, Price) with CK=BookType

   	This is also BCNF
